# MastermindRemake
Similar remake to the game Mastermind.

Instructions

Click the largre circles to change the colours for your guess and click submit to check whether the code is wrong/right.
The smaller circles will change colours respectively to your guess. For example, if the first small circle is green, that means your first large circle is the right colour in the right position. If it's orange, then the colour is in the code somewhere but it is in the wrong position, and if the small circle is black that means the colour is not in the code at all.

(The code can have duplicate colours e.g the code could be 'red, red, black, white')
